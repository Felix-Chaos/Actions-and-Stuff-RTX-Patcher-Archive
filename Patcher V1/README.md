## ⚠️ Important Notice

This is a **community-driven RTX enhancement project** for *Actions & Stuff* by **Oreville Studios**.  
The patcher **applies fixes and RTX enhancements to your own copy** of A&S — it does **not** distribute any part of the original resource pack.  

We kindly ask all users **not to share their patched copies** of A&S Enhanced for RTX publicly.  

You can always find the latest stable builds on the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Felix-Chaos/A-S-Minecraft-RTX-Community-Patcher/releases/latest).

## 💡 What Is *A&S RTX Patcher*?

**A&S RTX Patcher for BetterRTX** is a **community-built patching tool** that converts the original *Actions & Stuff* Minecraft Marketplace pack into an **RTX-compatible version** for Windows Bedrock Edition.

It works by:

* Combining your **official Marketplace copy** (or local `.zip`/`.mcpack`) with the **community RTX modification**
* Generating a **new patched version** that supports full **BetterRTX lighting**, reflections, and PBR materials
* Supporting both **singleplayer and multiplayer (server)** environments

This ensures RTX visuals are properly integrated **without redistributing** any copyrighted pack data.

## 🚀 How to Use

### 🧱 Option 1 - Normal Patcher (Recommended)

1. Head to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Felix-Chaos/A-S-Minecraft-RTX-Community-Patcher/releases/latest).

2. Download the Normal Patcher:
   * **A&S RTX Patcher** → for version **1.7**  

3. Run the `.exe` and follow the prompts:

   * Choose **Marketplace Mode** to auto-detect your installed pack  
   * Or choose **ZIP/MCPACK Mode** and manually select your pack

4. The patcher will automatically generate the RTX-enabled version. Make sure:

   * BetterRTX is installed and active  
   * The patched pack is **at the top of your resource pack list**

If any issues occur:

* Double-check the pack version  
* Re-run the patcher with admin privileges  
* Temporarily disable other texture packs

---

### 🧩 Option 2 — Universal Patcher:

For advanced users or legacy versions (1.3–1.7):

1. Download the **Universal A&S Patcher** and the correct **Patch File** (`.zip`).  
2. Launch the executable and select the patch file from the menu.  
3. Select your local A&S pack source (Marketplace, zip, or mcpack).  
4. Confirm the patching process, it will merge your files and apply RTX features.

Universal mode is ideal for testing custom patch files or rebuilding older pack versions.
